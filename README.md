## discrete-homework

My homework for Discrete Probability Theory. See in [homeworks](./homeworks/).

### Template

From https://github.com/kdkasad/typst-homework-template.

### Usage

PDFs should be compiled. Run `mise run compile` to generate my homework docs.

> Make sure you have font `Times New Roman`. Otherwise it'll fall back to default fonts.

I use LLM-generated Python script (numpy, scipy, ...) to **check** my answer. Run `mise run compute` to run copied python script.
